# ChessChain Signature Verification Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the cryptographic signature verification in the ChessChain system.

## Problem Summary

The blockchain verification system was failing because:

1. The frontend was using Ethereum (secp256k1) keys for signature generation
2. The backend ChessChain API expected Ed25519 keys
3. The key encoding was inconsistent (hex vs base64)

## Solution

We've updated the system to use Ed25519 keys throughout:

1. Frontend now generates Ed25519 keys using TweetNaCl.js
2. Keys are properly encoded/decoded in base64 format
3. ChessChain API now handles both base64 and hex formats for compatibility

## Changes Made

### Frontend

1. **Register.jsx**
   - Changed key generation from Ethereum to Ed25519
   - Added proper key storage in localStorage during registration
   - Updated registration payload to use base64 keys

2. **Game.jsx**
   - Updated move signing to use Ed25519 instead of Ethereum
   - Modified signature format to base64
   - Improved error handling for key operations

3. **Login.jsx**
   - Added verification of key presence in localStorage
   - Improved warning messages for missing keys

### Backend

1. **blockchain-bridge.js**
   - Updated submitMove function to properly handle base64 keys
   - Improved logging of signature operations
   - Enhanced error handling for cryptographic operations

2. **blockchain.js**
   - Updated verifySignature function to delegate verification to the blockchain API
   - Removed dependency on ethers.js

### ChessChain Python API

1. **api.py**
   - Updated verify_signature endpoint to handle both base64 and hex formats
   - Improved error handling and reporting
   - Added detailed logging for signature verification

2. **models.py**
   - No changes needed as it was already using Ed25519 correctly

## Testing

To test the signature verification:

1. Run `./generate-test-keys.sh` to create test keypairs
2. Run `source test_keypairs.txt` to load the keys into your environment
3. Run `./test-blockchain-game.sh` to test the system with two players

## Future Improvements

1. Consider using a more secure key storage method than localStorage
2. Add key rotation capabilities for enhanced security
3. Implement more robust error handling for cryptographic operations
4. Add unit tests for signature verification
