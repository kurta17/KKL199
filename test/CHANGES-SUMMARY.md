## Previous Changes (Bypass Registration System)

### SQL Fixes

- Created `emergency_bypass_fix.sql` with minimal changes needed:
  - Removed foreign key constraint between tables
  - Created open RLS policies for development
  - Enabled RLS with open permissions

### Backend Fixes

- Enhanced the `simple-bypass.js` controller with:
  - Better error logging
  - Improved public key formatting
  - More detailed success messages

- Updated `bypass.js` routes to properly handle controller loading
  - Added fallbacks when controllers are unavailable
  - Improved error handling

- Fixed route mounting in `index.js` to ensure proper URL path

### Frontend Fixes

- Enhanced `Register.jsx` component with:
  - Better error handling
  - More detailed logging
  - Improved bypass fallback mechanism

- Updated `api.js` service with:
  - Better error detection
  - More informative logs
  - Clearer indication when bypass is being used

### Testing & Documentation

- Created `test-bypass-endpoint.sh` to test the API directly
- Created `test-frontend-registration.sh` to help test frontend registration  
- Created `COMPREHENSIVE-BYPASS-GUIDE.md` with full documentation
- Updated README with bypass system information

### Helper Scripts

- Created `emergency-bypass-fix.sh` to apply minimal SQL changes
- Updated `check-bypass-route.sh` to test route availability

## Next Steps

1. Follow the instructions in `emergency-bypass-fix.sh` to apply SQL changes
2. Test registration with the provided scripts
3. Use the bypass system for ongoing development
4. Refer to `COMPREHENSIVE-BYPASS-GUIDE.md` for detailed information

## Note

This bypass system is for **development only** and should not be used in production. It intentionally bypasses security features to make development easier.
